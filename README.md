### About this site:
This domain is used to test out a variety of things. Trying my best to keep it updated with some of the latest projects that I am working on. The pandemic put a halt on some stuff, but trying to get them back up. The theme of the site will also be periodically updated. 

### Various Links:

### Update: 7/15/2021
I am goign to be deploying a new website to this domain soon. It is going to be a simple web app with possibly my resume right on this page. I will include links to other projects in this page as well.
